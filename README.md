# Maths-Drop
This is a small project taken up as part of my Design Patterns coursework in my second 
year of studying Computer Science at the University of Salford.
##Goal of the Game
The aim is to collect as many points as possible by inputting the correct answer to the 
falling equations. \
To do so, you must type in your answer so it appears on your player and then collide 
with the block you have just answered.  Colliding with the wrong block (or choosing
the wrong answer) will subtract from your score. \
You earn a gold star for every 16 points (incorrect answers do not subtract from this 
count) and you earn more points on a higher difficulty!
## In-Game Controls
 **Q** : Pause the game and return to the main menu (game state is preserved) \
 **P** : Pause the game  
 **C** : Clear the input on the player  
 **Any Digit** : Add the input digit to the player  
 **+** or **-** : Change the sign of your answer (numpad is best for these)  
 **Spacebar** : Toggle the selected sign of your answer  
 **Left Arrow** : Move the player left  
 **Right Arrow** : Move the player right  
 
 ###### Numpad arrow keys are also supported
 
 ##I'm stuck?!
 If you can't find a button to escape a screen then press Q.  This will always take you 
 back to the main menu. If it doesn't then let me know ASAP!
 
 ### Happy solving!
