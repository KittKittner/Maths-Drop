# Maths-Drop
This is a small project taken up as part of my Design Patterns coursework in my second 
year of studying Computer Science at the University of Salford.
##Goal of the Game
The aim is to collect as many points as possible by inputting the correct answer to the 
falling equations. \
To do so, you must type in your answer so it appears on your player and then collide 
with the block you have just answered.  Colliding with the wrong block (or choosing
the wrong answer) will subtract from your score. \
You earn a gold star for every 10 correct answers (incorrect answers do not subtract from this 
count) but you cannot gain any stars if you have negative score.
## In-Game Controls
 **Q** : Pause the game and return to the main menu (game state is preserved) \
 **P** : Pause the game \
 **Left Arrow** : Move the player left \
 **Right Arrow** : Move the player right 
 ###### Numpad arrow keys are also supported

 ## I'm stuck?!
 If you should you find yourself too far in the negative score (or you would like to)
 then you can quit out of your current game (by pressing Q) and reset everything in 
 the settings menu. 
 ######I would also advise choosing an easier difficulty, wherever possible.
 
 If you can't find a button to escape a screen then press Q.  This will always take you 
 back to the main menu. If it doesn't then let me know ASAP!
 
 ### Happy solving!
